# twiddler
A Python library for general video animation, built with a Cairo backend.

### Currently supports:
- Simultaneous animations
- etc

An example full-length video can be found at <a href="https://youtu.be/-gkXH_GzHC8?si=Y9nPoBaXzlLfNEou">https://youtu.be/-gkXH_GzHC8?si=Y9nPoBaXzlLfNEou</a>. Excuse some of the graphics, I'm not an artist.

### Why use this?

The twiddler library, unlike some Python alternatives like manim, allows for simultaneous (parallel) animations of shapes and groups of shapes through the use of time-based <i>triggers</i>. This means that hundreds, if not thousands, of shapes can be programmatically manipulated to act at the same time.

### Inspiration

Huge thanks to the authors of Manim, ManimPango, Cairo and PyCairo; your work laid the foundation for this library.

### This is a work in progress! Docs coming soon...
